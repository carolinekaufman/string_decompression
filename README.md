# String Decompression
Problem from Google's Technical Development Guide: Advanced Path

I'm studying Python on my own these days, so I thought it would
be useful to explore this problem using Python.

python decompress.py --test runs all automated tests

python decompress.py --decompress reads strings to decompress from stdin

python decompress.py --decompress filename reads strings from the given file
