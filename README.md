Problem from Google's Technical Development Guide: Advanced Path

https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/advanced/compress-decompression#code-challenge

### Instructions
python decompress.py --test runs all automated tests

python decompress.py --decompress reads strings to decompress from stdin

python decompress.py --decompress filename reads strings from the given file
